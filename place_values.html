    <p>Place value, in mathematics, describes the value of every digit in a number depending on its position. These positions start from the units place (ones place). The order of the place value of digits in a number from right to left is expressed as ones/units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and so on</p>
    <p>Place value is the value of a digit according to its position in the number such as ones, tens, hundreds, and so on. For example, the place value of 5 in 3458 is 5 tens, or 50. However, the place value of 5 in 5781 is expressed as 5 thousands or 5,000. It is important to understand that a digit can be the same, but its value depends on its position in the number.</p>
    <p>Place value charts help us to make sure that the digits are aligned in the correct places. A place value chart displays the correct position or place of a digit in a number. To identify the positional values or worth of different digits in a number accurately, we first write the given digits in the place value chart to check their position. In order to make the process easier, the larger numbers are divided into periods that are separated with the help of commas.</p>
