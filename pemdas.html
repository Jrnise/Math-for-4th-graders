    <p>PEMDAS is an acronym for the words parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Given two or more operations in a single expression, the order of the letters in PEMDAS tells you what to calculate first, second, third and so on, until the calculation is complete. If there are grouping symbols in the expression, PEMDAS tells you to calculate within the grouping symbols first.</p>
    <p>The letters PEMDAS and the words parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction may not be very meaningful for someone trying to remember this order, so a phrase has also been attached with the letters in PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. If you can remember this phrase, then it may be easier to remember the order of operations given in PEMDAS.</p>
    <p>Without PEMDAS, there are no guidelines to obtain only one correct answer. As a very simple example, to calculate 2 * 4 + 7, I could multiply first, and then add to get 15. I also have the option to add first, then multiply and get 22. Which answer is correct? Using PEMDAS, the only correct answer is 15, because the order of the letters in PEMDAS tell me that multiplication, M, should be performed before addition, A.</p>
